# this is the constructor for the subroutine.

# If this input module uses all of the default values and does not need to define any new value, it is best to 
# skip implementing it altogether (just remove it), since we are inheriting this subroutine from the SUPER
# class
sub new()

	my $class = shift;

	# now we call the SUPER class's new function, since we are inheriting all the 
	# functions from the SUPER class (input.pm), we start by inheriting it's calls
	# and if we would like to overwrite some of its subroutines we can do that, otherwise
	# we don't need to include that subroutine
        my $self = $class->SUPER::new();

	# indicate that this is a text based file, with one line per call to get_time
	#	This option determines the behaviour of the engine. If this variable is set
	# 	to 0 it means that we return a single hash that contains multiple timstamp objects
	#	Setting it to 1 means that we return a single timesetamp object for each line that
	# 	contains a timestamp in the file.
	# 	
	# 	So if this is a traditional log file, it is usually better to leave this as 1 and 
	# 	process one line at a time.  Otherwise the tool might use too much memory and become
	#	slow (storing all the lines in a large log file in memory might not be such a good idea).
	#
	#	However if you are parsing a binary file, or a file that you know contains few timestamps
	# 	in it, it might make more sense to just parse the entire file and return a single value
	#	instead of making the engine call the module in a loop.

#

# This subroutine is called after the file has been verified, and before it is parsed.

	#
	# sometimes it might be good to initialize these global variables, to make sure they 
	# are not used again when parsing a new file.
	#
	# This method, init, is called by the engine before parsing any new file.  That makes
	# this method ideal to initialize or null the values of global variables if they are used.
	# This is especially cruical when recursive parsing is used, to make sure that when the next file 
	# is being parsed by the module there isn't any mix-up between files.

	# source ip (src-ip) or some other values that might be of interest yet are not part of the main variables.
	# Another interesting field that might be included in the extra field is the URL ('url').  If it is possible to 
	# show the user where he or she can get additional information regarding the event that is being produced 
	# this is a good place to put it in, for example Windows events found inside the Windows Event Log contain 
	# valuable information that can be further read... so in the evt.pm module a reference to the particular event is

# could also lead to the module trying to parse files that it is not capable of parsing.

=pod

=head1 NAME

structure - An example input module for log2timeline

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

A default constructor for the input module. There are no parameters passed to the constructor, however it defines the behaviour of the module.  That is to say it indicates whether or not this module parses a file or a directory, and it also defines if this is a log file that gets parsed line-by-line or a file that parses all the timestamp objects and returns them all at once.

=item init

A small routine that takes no parameters and is called by the engine before a file is parsed.  This routine takes care of initializing global variables, so that no values are stored from a previous file that got parsed by the module to avoid confusion.

=item end

Similar to the init routine, except this routine is called by the engine when the parsing is completed.  The purpose of this routine is to close all database handles or other handles that got opened by the module itself (excluding the file handle) and to remove any temporary files that might still be present.

=item get_time

This is the main routine of the module.  This is the routine that parses the actual file and produces timestamp objects that get returned to the main engine for further processing.  The routine reads the file or directory and extracts timestamps and other needed information to create a timestamp object that then gets returned to the engine, either line-by-line or all in one (as defined in the constructor of the module).

=item verify

The purpose of this routine is to verify the structure of the file or directory being passed to the module and tell the engine whether not this module is capable of parsing the file in question or not. This routine is therfore very important for the recursive search of the engine, and it is very important to make this routine as compact and optimized as possible to avoid slowing the tool down too much.

=item get_help()

Returns a string that contains a longer version of the description of the output module, as well as possibly providing some assistance in how the module should be used.

=item get_version()

Returns the version number of the module.

=item get_description()

Returns a string that contains a short description of the module. This short description is used when a list of all available modules is printed out.
